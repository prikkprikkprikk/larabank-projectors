# A bank for my daughters' pocket money

These days, no one uses cash anymore, and kids need to be able to use their pocket money online.

So I'm making this app to keep track of their transactions and balances.

It's based on Spatie's [Larabank built with projectors](https://github.com/spatie/larabank-projectors), which is an example app used in the documentation of [laravel-event-projector](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-event-sourcing).
